# Tower
The provided HTML code seems to be a basic structure for a webpage that appears to involve a game of "Towers of Hanoi." 
#### Description of the HTML Code:
1. The code defines an HTML structure, starting with the `<html>` tag and includes the `<head>` and `<body>` sections.
2. In the `<head>` section:
   - It links to an external stylesheet `styles.css` using the `<link>` tag. This suggests that there is some styling for the webpage.
   - It includes a JavaScript file `hanoi.js` using the `<script>` tag. This file is likely used for game logic.
#### Future Enhancements:
To enhance this code, you could consider the following:
1. **Improved User Interface:** Enhance the visual design and user experience of the game interface by using more CSS and potentially introducing animations.
2. **Levels and Difficulty:** Allow users to choose difficulty levels by varying the number of disks, making the game more challenging.
3. **Scoring System:** Implement a scoring system to track the user's performance, such as the number of moves or time taken to complete the game.
#### How to Run the Code:
To run the code, follow these steps:
1. Save the HTML code in an `.html` file, e.g., `towers_of_hanoi.html`.
2. Create the necessary CSS file (styles.css), and JavaScript files (hanoi.js and tower.js) if they don't already exist.
